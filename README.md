* Flexible Scheduling: Individuals can indicate their available days and times, providing flexibility for appointment scheduling.

## Technical Details:

* Tech Stack: Developed entirely using Next.js, the project leverages the framework's capabilities for unified front-end and back-end integration.
* Database Management: Prisma.io facilitates communication between the application and a MySQL database housed in a Docker container.
* Deployment and Hosting: Vercel serves as the hosting platform for the application, ensuring seamless deployment. The production database is managed through the PlanetScale platform service.

## Presentation Focus:
In the workshop, we uses Ignite Call as a case study to showcase the implementation of security practices, with a primary focus on Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Tools like Snyk will be employed to scan dependencies, ensuring the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities early in the development process. Additionally, we'll utilize CodeSee to visually understand the application's codebase, emphasizing how these practices contribute to a more secure DevOps workflow.

We dissected Ignite Call, demonstrating real-world applications of DevSecOps principles and tools to create a robust and secure development pipeline."
