## üíª Project
The Ignite Call project was built for booking appointments from a calendar with Google Calendar integration. The user can register on the app from their Google account and indicate the days of the week and times when they will be available to schedule appointments. Every appointment registered in the application is integrated with Google Calendar, which allows the user to check their new appointments directly on the Google platform.
Ignite Call was built entirely on a Next.js project and used the mechanisms provided by the framework to create and integrate the front-end and back-end from a single code repository. Communication between the application and the database was done using the Prisma.io tool and using a MySQL database in a Docker container. The production database was published from the PlanetScale platform service and the Vercel service was used to host the application.
